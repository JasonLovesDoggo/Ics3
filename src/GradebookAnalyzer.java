/*Your task is to create a program that uses arrays and loops together to do a task.Rather than being told exactly what your program should do, you now have an opportunity to plan, develop and submit a program of your choosing.Here is a list of possible programs you might choose to develop:Ask the user to enter his or her last 5 assignment marks and tell them the average.Ask the user to enter his or her favourite hockey/baseball/sports star statistics for the past 5 games and tell them the average.Create a program that will create an array of 10 random values between 1 and 100, display it to the user and tell the user the max and min values.Create a program that will create an array of 10 random math/science/etc. questions, AND a second array of the 10 random answers that correspond to each question. The program should then ask the user 10 random questions.Start by doing a top-down design and flowchart. Then you can start coding!Make sure to include in your program:variablesat least one constantloopsarraysTo complete your program, you might also have to incorporate the other concepts you have learned in this course, such as selection (if ... then ... else or switch statements) and nested if ... then ... else statements.You must also ensure thatyou complete and submit a flowchart for your program.your source code includes commenting.your program includes a user-friendly interface.Being given so much freedom and choice is a great thing, but it also might be a bit of a challenge for you to come up with ideas.The following list is meant as “creative fodder”. These are ideas, words and concepts that might help you think of what type of program you would like to create:Sports statisticsRandom number gamesInteresting math equationsPopulations of countriesComputer specificationsStatistics about animalsDice gamesGuess that animal gamesDistance, speed, acceleration calculatorMultiple choice quizzesAlso, before you decide on your project idea, consider some of the assignments that you have already completed. You have created projects related to a wide variety of topics, so maybe you would like to expand on some of those ideas. */public class ShowWhatYouKnow {    public static void main(String[] args) {    }}
